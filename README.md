# 🌧️ Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

### 🌱 **IntelliHack 5.0 – Team TechSpark**

This repository contains our solution to the Weather Forecasting Machine Learning Task for IntelliHack 5.0.

---

## 📌 **Problem Statement**
Farmers depend on precise weather forecasts for irrigation, planting, and harvesting decisions. Traditional weather forecasts often lack accuracy for hyper-local conditions. Our goal is to leverage historical weather data to predict daily rainfall probabilities accurately, assisting farmers in making informed decisions.
